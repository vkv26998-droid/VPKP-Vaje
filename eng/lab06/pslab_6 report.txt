1) Why is TOTP more secure than SMS?

TOTP is more encrypted to SMS and one time password will be always safe in the application whereas SMS is not encrypted.
 
2)What happens if you lose access to Bitwarden Authenticator?

If we lose the password of Bitwarden it will be not possible to login if we are using 2FA method.If we are not using this method then access will be lost .
 
3)Do all services support TOTP? Why or why not?

I think its yes most of the application use 2 methods for login either through password or multifactor authentication.

Reflection and analysis
1)How does the security score increase as you add length?

Yes, Using pwscore the security score increased if the length of the password is increased.

2)How do special characters affect the score?

If we add special charecter to th password score will be changed and it is more increased compare to the normal password.

3)How does a “passphrase” score compare to a classic password?

When checking the pwscore of passphrase is very high compare to the classic password.Classic password provides a score between 35-70 whereas passphrase scores more than that.

4) Which password would you recommend for everyday use and why?

I would choose passphrase because it is more secure and not able to guess by the attacker and also easy to rememeber by the user.
